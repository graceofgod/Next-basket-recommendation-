# Next basket recommendation 
In this project, I used Instacart’s data provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data) to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order, based on customers’ purchase history. In order to capture sequential behavior and general tastes of users, I applied feature engineering to extract representative features from the users’ whole purchase behavior. Meanwhile, I employed a neural network to model complicated interaction among users and products. The result shows this approach can be capable of generating accurate recommendation about products that a user may want to purchase again.
